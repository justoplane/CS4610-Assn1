# CS 4610 Express React Starter App
This simple application just gives a basic React+Vite/Express setup. It is meant to be a starting point for simple projects but is lacking many features that a full-fledged application would have.
In the future you will be given a more complete application to work with.

## Getting Started
1. Fork/Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` in the server directory
3. Run `npm install` in the client directory
4. Create a file called `.env` in the server directory and copy the contents of `.env.example` into it. DON'T RENAME THE EXAMPLE FILE.
5. Run `npm run dev` in the server directory
6. Run `npm run dev` in the client directory
7. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
Make sure are running the server and client in separate terminals.

Happy coding!
